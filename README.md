# Inventory and sales management

This project aims to develop an inventory and sales management system. It will be a straightforward system, allowing the creation and management of users with three different levels of access. Users will be able to create products, manage inventory (including quantities, prices, etc.), and oversee sales by adding, removing, and generating reports for visualization.
